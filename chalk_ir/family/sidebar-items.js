This lets us map from a type like `Ty<TF>` to the parameter `TF`."],["Lookup","Given an interned representation, convert to the uninterned enum `DataType`. Used to (e.g.) convert from `TF::Type` to `Ty<TF>`."],["TypeFamily","A \"type family\" encapsulates the concrete representation of certain \"core types\" from chalk-ir. All the types in chalk-ir are parameterized by a `TF: TypeFamily`, and so (e.g.) if they want to store a type, they don't store a `Ty<TF>` instance directly, but rather prefer a `TF::Type`. You can think of `TF::Type` as the interned representation (and, indeed, it may well be an interned pointer, e.g. in rustc)."]]});
